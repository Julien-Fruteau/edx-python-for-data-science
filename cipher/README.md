# CYPHER

"A cipher is a secret code for a language. In this case study, we will
explore a cipher that is reported by contemporary Greek historians to have
been used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to generals during
times of war.

The Caesar cipher shifts each letter of this message to another letter
in the alphabet, which is a fixed number of letters away from the original.
If our encryption key were 1, we would shift h to the next letter i, i to
the next letter j, and so on. If we reach the end of the alphabet, which
for us is the space character, we simply loop back to a. To decode
the message, we make a similar shift, except we move the same number
of steps backwards in the alphabet."

Cypher is build with Python, and is part of edX Case Study from the course
Python for Research.

In order to respect edX 'Academic Honesty' policy, all my commit code
has been already submitted for grading.
Hence, if you commit code, it has sole purpose to improve
the project to make it more efficient, more elegant,...
Thus it represents an occasion for those willing to share and demonstrate their
knowledge, as for me an occasion to improve myself.

If you are participating into this course as well, refrain to copy code.
