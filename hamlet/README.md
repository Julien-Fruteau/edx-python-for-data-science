# Hamlet 

"In this case study, we will find and plot the distribution of word frequencies
for each translation of Hamlet.  Perhaps the distribution of word frequencies
of Hamlet depends on the translation --- let's find out!""

Hamlet is build with Python, and is an edX Case Study from the course
Python for Research.

In order to respect edX 'Academic Honesty' policy, all the code I commit
has been already submitted for grading.
Hence, if yourself want to commit code, it has sole purpose to improve
the project to make it more efficient, more elegant,...
Thus it represents an occasion for those willing to share and demonstrate
their knowledge, as for me an occasion to improve myself.

If you are participating into this course as well, refrain to copy code.

Cheers,

Julien.
